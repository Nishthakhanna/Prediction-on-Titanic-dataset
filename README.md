# Prediction-on-Titanic-dataset
### 01
Greetings everyone, this is my first machine learning code in python that I have uploaded on GitHub. It is an ipynb file. 
At first I downloaded the Titanic Dataset from the internet and then started to preprocess and clean it with whatever knowledge I have gained during my trainig. 
Then I went to to train the dataset on 4 differnt models, using 4 different algorithms and predicted whether a person survived or not and also found out the accuracy of my models.
